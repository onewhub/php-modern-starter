## Included Configurations

This project comes pre-configured with:

### JWT Authentication
LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle is set up. Ensure you provide secret_key or public_key/private_key in your JWT configuration.

Uses Doctrine ORM and Migrations. You can configure your connection via DATABASE_URL in .env.

Configured to support symfony/redis-messenger for async task processing with Redis.

### CORS Setup
NelmioCORSBundle allows cross-origin requests. You can adjust origins and methods in nelmio_cors.yaml.

### Property Info / Serializer / Validator
Enabled with Symfony default configuration. Suitable for use with DTOs, OpenAPI generation, and form handling.

### Webpack Encore (Optional)
If using a separate frontend, disable or adjust webpack_encore config to prevent errors from missing output_path.
